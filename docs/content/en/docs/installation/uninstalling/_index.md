## ðŸš¨ Warning ðŸš¨

Uninstalling the Aiven Operator for Kubernetes can remove the resources created in Aiven, possibly resulting in data loss.

## [Helm](https://helm.sh) based installation

Find out the name of your deployment:

```bash
$ helm list

NAME               	NAMESPACE	REVISION	UPDATED                                 	STATUS  	CHART                     	APP VERSION
aiven-operator     	default  	1       	2021-09-09 10:56:14.623700249 +0200 CEST	deployed	aiven-operator-v0.1.0     	v0.1.0     
aiven-operator-crds	default  	1       	2021-09-09 10:56:05.736411868 +0200 CEST	deployed	aiven-operator-crds-v0.1.0	v0.1.0
```

Remove the CRDs:

```bash
$ helm uninstall aiven-operator-crds

release "aiven-operator-crds" uninstalled
```

Remove the operator:

```bash
$ helm uninstall aiven-operator

release "aiven-operator" uninstalled
```

## Dealing with expired tokens

Aiven resources need to have an accompanying secret that contains the token that is used to authorize the manipulation of that resource.
If that token expired then you will not be able to delete the custom resource and deletion will also hang until the situation is resolved.
The recommended approach to deal with that situation is to patch a valid token into the secret again so that proper cleanup of aiven resources can take place.

## Hanging deletions

To protect the secrets that the operator is using from deletion, it adds the [finalizer](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/finalizers/) `finalizers.aiven.io/needed-to-delete-services` to the secret.
This solves a race condition that happens when deleting a namespace, where there is a possibility of the secret getting deleted before the resource that uses it.
When the controller is deleted it may not cleanup the finalizers from all secrets.
If there is a secret with this finalizer blocking deletion of a namespace, for now please do

```bash
kubectl patch secret <offending-secret> -p '{"metadata":{"finalizers":null}}' --type=merge
```

to remove the finalizer.
