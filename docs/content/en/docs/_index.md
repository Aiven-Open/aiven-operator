# Welcome to Aiven Operator
Provision and manage [Aiven services](https://aiven.io) from your Kubernetes cluster.

Currently, the operator supports [Aiven for PostgreSQL](./postgresql/) and [Aiven for Kafka](./kafka) services.

# What is Aiven?

Aiven offers managed services for the best open source data technologies, on a cloud of your choice.

We offer multiple cloud options because we believe that everyone should have access to great data platforms wherever they host their applications. Our customers tell us they love it because they know that they arenâ€™t locked in to one particular cloud platform for all their data needs.

Currently, the Operator supports [Aiven for PostgreSQL](./postgresql/) and [Aiven for Kafka](./kafka) services.
