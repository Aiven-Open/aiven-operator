## Getting Started
You must have a working [Go environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) and then clone the repository:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:aiven/aiven-operator.git
$ cd aiven-operator
```

## Building
The project uses the `make` build system.

Building the operator binary and Docker image:
```bash
$ make build
$ make docker-build IMG=aiven-operator:latest
$ make docker-push IMG=aiven-operator:latest
```

## Testing
As of now, we only support integration tests who interact directly with Aiven. To run the tests, you'll need an [Aiven account](https://console.aiven.io/signup?utm_source=github&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=k8s-operator&utm_content=signup) and an [Aiven authentication code](https://help.aiven.io/en/articles/2059201-authentication-tokens).

```bash
$ make test AIVEN_PROJECT_NAME="<your-project-name>" AIVEN_TOKEN="<your-token>"
```

## Documentation
The documentation is written in markdown and generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Docsy](https://themes.gohugo.io/docsy/). Make sure to have Hugo installed on your machine.

To run the documentation live preview:
```bash
$ make serve-docs
```

And open the `http://localhost:1313/aiven-operator/` page in your web browser.

The [API Reference](https://aiven.github.io/aiven-operator/docs/api-reference/) section is generated automatically from the source code during the documentation deployment. To generate it locally, run the following command:
```bash
$ make generate-api-reference
```

To build the documentation locally (outputs to `docs/public`), run:
```
$ make generate-docs
```

## Running locally
Install the `cert-manager` operator. **This and the next step are only required if you want to run the webhooks, since they are not mandatory when running locally**.
> cert-manager is used to manage the Operator [webhooks](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/) TLS certificates
```bash
$ make install-cert-manager
```

Install the Aiven Operator CRDs by running:
```bash
$ make install
```

Run the operator locally:
> Alternatively, you can execute `make run ENABLE_WEBHOOKS=false` to disable the webhooks, not requiring the cert-manager operator.
```bash
$ make run
````

To uninstall the operator, run:

```bash
make undeploy
```
