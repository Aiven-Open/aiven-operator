## Getting Started

You must have a working [Go environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) and then clone the repository:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:aiven/aiven-operator.git
$ cd aiven-operator
```

## Building

The project uses the `make` build system.

Building the operator binary:

```bash
$ make build
```

## Testing

As of now, we only support integration tests who interact directly with Aiven. To run the tests, you'll need
an [Aiven account](https://console.aiven.io/signup?utm_source=github&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=k8s-operator&utm_content=signup)
and an [Aiven authentication code](https://help.aiven.io/en/articles/2059201-authentication-tokens).

```bash
$ make test-acc AIVEN_PROJECT_NAME="<your-project-name>" AIVEN_TOKEN="<your-token>"
```

## Documentation

The documentation is written in markdown and generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
and [Docsy](https://themes.gohugo.io/docsy/). 

To run the documentation live preview:

```bash
$ make serve-docs
```

And open the `http://localhost:1313/aiven-operator/` page in your web browser.

The [API Reference](https://aiven.github.io/aiven-operator/docs/api-reference/) section is generated automatically from
the source code during the documentation deployment. To generate it locally, run the following command:

```bash
$ make generate-docs
```

To build the documentation locally (outputs to `docs/public`), run:

```
$ make generate-docs
```
