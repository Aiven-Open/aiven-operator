## Getting Started

You must have a working [Go environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) and then clone the repository:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:aiven/aiven-operator.git
cd aiven-operator
```

## Building

The project uses the `make` build system.

Building the operator binary:

```shell
make build
```

## Testing

As of now, we only support integration tests who interact directly with Aiven. To run the tests, you'll need
an [Aiven account](https://console.aiven.io/signup?utm_source=github&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=k8s-operator&utm_content=signup)
and an [Aiven authentication code](https://help.aiven.io/en/articles/2059201-authentication-tokens).

```shell
make test-acc AIVEN_PROJECT_NAME="<your-project-name>" AIVEN_TOKEN="<your-token>"
```

## Documentation

The documentation is written in markdown and generated by [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)
and [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). 

To run the documentation live preview:

```shell
make serve-docs
```

And open the `http://localhost:8000/aiven-operator/` page in your web browser.

The documentation API Reference section is generated automatically from
the source code during the documentation deployment. To generate it locally, run the following command:

```shell
make generate-api-reference
```
